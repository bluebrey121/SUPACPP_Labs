Hi, this is my submission for the second assignment of the SUPACOO cource. 
Unfortunately due to circumstances around my project I have not been able to fully complete this assignment.
I hope that what I have submitted is enough for some partial credit. 

To run the code navigate to the Lab3and4 on the terminal and type make. 
This will generate an excecutable called TestFiniteFunctions. Run the excecutable on the terminal.
This will produce three graphs in Outputs/png of the data in a specific file as well as the three overlayed functions.
I have not had time to tune the parameters to get them to fit properly.
